# Organizer3000
A simple application(ongoing) to save useful information I find on the internet.

This was written during my first programming class. I wanted to work on something outside of the classroom, but my coding education wasn't
fleshed out to where I could design something that I actually thought was cool. So Organizer3000 was born. A simple application that utilized
the basics of the Java programming language.
